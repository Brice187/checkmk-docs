== Introduction

For a monitoring system to receive more information from an endpoint other than that it is accessible,
help is required from the target system.  For example -- how else can {CMK} know
how full a server’s storage volume is without that system somehow providing
the information?  The component that provides this information is always an
active piece of software -- namely an agent.

There are situations where one does not need to _install_ an additional
agent -- since one that can be used is already present. The best example
here is SNMP.  All manageable network devices and appliances have a built-in
link:snmp.html[SNMP agent].

As always, there is an exception: the monitoring of _network services_.
For example -- by its nature a web application can be accessed via HTTP and be
monitored over the same connection. But even in this case there is usually an
additional agent in use which provides further server data to the monitoring.

The following table shows the four different ways that {CMK} can access
services to be monitored:

These are described as [.guihint]#Active Checks#. |None

=== Monitoring by events

Until now we have only discussed _active_ monitoring -- {CMK}’s showpiece discipline.  There is also the reverse method: namely that by which the
target system itself sends messages to the monitoring, e.g., via syslog or
SNMP traps. For this entire subject {CMK} has the _Event console_
which is described in its link:ec.html[own article].


[#agents]
== The {CMK} agent

=== Download and installation

As described, you require a {CMK} agent in order to monitor servers
and workstations.  Agents for eleven different operating system families
are currently maintained in the {CMK}-Project. All of these agents
are components in {CMK}, and are available for downloading via the
{CMK}-Server’s Web-GUI. Additionally, in the {EE} there is the
_Agent Bakery_. This enables you to ‘bake’ your own agents containing
a personalised configuration and collection of plug-ins. This can even be
done individually and differently for each host.


=== Installation via the download page

The agents are accessed via the [.guihint]#WATO#-module icon:icon_agents[]
[.guihint]#Monitoring agents#. In the {EE}, you will be brought to the
[.guihint]#Agent bakery#.  From there the icon:icon_agents[] [.guihint]#Agent files#
button then takes you to the download page for the agents and their plug-ins.
The {RE} takes you directly to the download page:

[{image-border}]
image::agent_download.png[]

The packeting agents for Windows (`check_mk_agent.msi`) and Linux
(`.deb` or `.rpm`u files) are found right in the first section.
After installing these packages the agent is basically ready to run,
and you can begin monitoring.  All further configuration is achieved via
configurations data, and plug-ins are installed by downloading them from
the same page and copying them into the appropriate folder.


=== Details of agents for specific operating systems

The agents’ structure, configuration and capabilities vary depending on the
operating system. For this reason details for specific agents can be found
in their own articles:

- link:agent_linux.html[Monitoring Linux]
- link:agent_windows.html[Monitoring Windows]


[#bakery]
== Installation via the Agent Bakery

=== Introduction

While it is true that the {CMK} agent can function ‘naked’ immediately -- without
needing configuration, and without plug-ins -- nonetheless in some
cases the agent does need to be set up. Some examples:

* Restriction of access to specific IP-Addresses
* Monitoring of ORACLE data bases (plug-in and configuration are required)
* Monitoring of text log files (plug-in, data names and text-pattern required)
* Utilization of the link:inventory.html[{CMK} inventory system] (plug-in required)

{cee-only}
If you have one of the {CEE} you can package personalised agents with the
[.guihint]#Agent Bakery#.  In this way, alongside the existing agents, you can also
create agent packages that contain configurations and extra plug-ins. These
packages are ideal for automatic-distribution, however, they can
also be installed manually.  You can even create personalized agents for
specific groups of hosts.  This allows great flexibility through the use of
the automated link:agent_deployment.html[agent deployment].

The bakery is accessed via [.guihint]#WATO > icon:icon_agents[] Monitoring agents#:

[{image-border}]
image::agent_bakery_main.png[]

If you have not yet made settings for specific hosts, there is only a single
default agent configuration.  With the Bakery
{CMK} version {v16} supports the Windows, Linux, Solaris and AIX
operating systems. For Linux you have a choice between the packet formats RPM
(SUSE, RedHat, CentOS), and DEB (Debian, Ubuntu), as well as a tarball that
is simply unpacked as `root` under `/`. Likewise, a tarball
is available for AIX, however this does not include automatic integration into the `inetd`.
The integration must be performed manually as a one-off action.
For Solaris there is again the tarball and a PKG package.

Every agent configuration has an explicit ID: its [.guihint]#hash#. A hash’s first
eight characters are displayed in the GUI. This hash will be a part of the
package version and embedded in its file name. Whenever you change something
in a package’s configuration or update {CMK}, the package’s hash will
also be changed. In this way the operating system’s package manager recognizes
that it is an update.  {CMK}’s version number would not suffice in such a case.


=== Configuration via Rules

The agent’s configuration can be altered -- as is so often the case
in {CMK} -- via link:wato_rules.html[rules]. These offer you the possibility of equipping different
hosts with differing settings or plug-ins.  Via the icon:button_rules[]
[.guihint]#Rules# button you can access a page which lists all rule sets that
affect the agents:

[{image-border}]
image::agent_rules.png[]

Let’s take the following example: you wish to limit the list of IP Adresses
that are permitted to access the agent. For this you select the
[.guihint]#Generic Options > Allowed agent access via IP address# rules set. Enter
one or more IP adresses as the rule’s value:

image::agent_rule_ipaccess.png[]

After saving with icon:button_monitoring_agents[],
return to the [.guihint]#Agent Bakery#. The
icon:button_bake_agents[] button ensures that the agent will be freshly
baked. The result -- you now have two configurations:

[{image-border}]
image::agent_bakery_agentlist.png[]

In the [.guihint]#Hosts# column you will find a list of hosts associated with the
relevant configuration. For space reasons the full list is abbreviated here.
The [.guihint]#VANILLA# and [.guihint]#GENERIC# names have a special role. These two
pseudo-hosts are always present and have the following functions:

[cols=2]
|===

|[.guihint]#VANILLA# |A virtual host whose agent contains only the default configuration, to which therefore none of the agent rules apply.
|[.guihint]#GENERIC# |A virtual host to which ALL rules with no defined additional conditions apply. The [.guihint]#GENERIC# entry is especially useful for installing agents on hosts that have not yet been incorporated in the monitoring.
|===


The more host-specific rules you deploy, the more different versions of
agents will be built.  The bakery makes sure that only such combinations of
configurations are built that will be used by at least one of the available
hosts.

By the way, in WATO you can also easily access a host’s agent packages via
the host’s Details and the icon:button_monitoring_agent[]
[.guihint]#Monitoring Agent# button:

[{image-border}]
image::download_host_agent.png[]

Why are packages for all operating systems offered for every host?  The answer
is very simple: if no agent is installed on a system {CMK} naturally cannot
recognise the operating system! In any case, once link:agent_deployment.html[automatic agent updates]
are activated you don’t need to do anything more.


=== Plug-ins

Many rules are concerned with the installation of various [.guihint]#plug-ins#. These
extend the agents for the monitoring of quite specific components. Most
of these are special applications such as data bases, for example. Alongside the
rule that activates a plug-in you will also find the settings for configuring
the plug-in. Here, for example, is the rule for monitoring MySQL:

image::agent_rule_mysql.png[]


=== Customising agents manually

Please note that on the target-system you *do not manually modify* the configuration files
of an agent that was created by the Bakery. This will work at first, but the
next update of the agent will cause the the changes to be lost. However
it is possible to install *additional* plug-ins without problems.


== When should an agent be updated?

Regardless of whether you monitor only a handful -- or even thousands of
hosts -- management of the {CMK} agents on all hosts is always a larger operation.
The link:agent_deployment.html[automatic update] of the agents in the {CEE} is however
a big help. Nonetheless, you should really only update the agents when:

* the update solves a problem affecting you, or
* the update includes required new functions.

In order for this to be possible a general rule applies in {CMK}: <b>newer
{CMK}-versions can fundamentally handle the output of older agents</b>.

Note: the reverse is not necessarily true. If an agent’s {CMK} version is
newer than that of the monitoring server it is possible that the output of
the target agent’s existing check plug-ins cannot be properly interpreted. In
such a case the affected services go into an {UNKNOWN} (please _do not
send_ a Crash-report in such a situation):

image::crashed_check.png[]


[#diagnostics]
== Error diagnosis

=== Testing agents via the command line

Although the agents for the various operating systems were independently
developed, from {CMK}’s point of view they all behave in the same way by
opening the TCP port 6556 for queries from the monitoring server. The query
protocol is absolutely simple: the server connects to the port and the data
flows in a readable text format from the agent. As soon as the data transfer
is completed the agent disconnects itself from the port. The agent basically
reads no data from the network!

A correctly-installed agent can be very easily queried from the command
line. The best way is directly from the {CMK} instance that is also actively
monitoring the agent. In this way you can be certain that the server’s IP
address will be accepted by agents. A suitable command is e.g. `telnet`:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} telnet 10.1.1.2 6556
Trying 10.1.1.2...
Connected to 10.1.1.2.
Escape character is '^]'.
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 1.6.0
AgentOS: linux
AgentDirectory: /etc/check_mk
DataDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent
SpoolDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent/spool
PluginsDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
----

With `nc` or `netcat` the data is returned ‘naked’. This is
useful for example, if you wish to use a script to process the data:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} nc 10.1.1.2 6556
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 1.6.0
AgentOS: linux
AgentDirectory: /etc/check_mk
DataDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent
SpoolDirectory: /var/lib/check_mk_agent/spool
PluginsDirectory: /usr/lib/check_mk_agent/plugins
----

The output always begins with the line
`+<<<check_mk>>>+`. Lines included in
`&lt;&lt;&lt;` and `&gt;&gt;&gt;` are called _Section
Headers_. These divide the agent output into sections.  Each section
contains related information and is usually simply the output from a diagnosis
command.  The `check_mk` section plays a special role. It contains
general information about the agent such as e.g., its version number.

If the host is already being monitored you can also fetch the data with the
`cmk -d` command.  This uses the IP address configured via WATO, allows
for a possibly reconfigured port number, and also the case of a special agent:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} cmk -d myhost123
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 1.6.0
----

If monitoring is already running regularly for the host in question a current
copy of the output can always be found in the `tmp/check_mk/cache`
directory:

[{shell-raw}]
----
{c-omd} cat tmp/check_mk/cache/myhost123
<<<check_mk>>>
Version: 1.6.0
----


[#diagnosticpage]
=== Diagnosis via the GUI

You can also conduct a diagnosis of the agents via the GUI. This takes all
settings into consideration and also supports SNMP devices and those queried
using special agents.  In effect, {CMK} simply attempts to always query
via TCP-Port 6556 _and_ SNMP simultaneously.  You can access the details
of a host’s diagnosis with the icon:icon_diagnose[] [.guihint]#Diagnostic#
button in WATO:

image::host_diag.png[]

You can try out quite a few of the settings (e.g., the SNMP community)
right away, and save them when successful.
